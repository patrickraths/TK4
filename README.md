# MVS TK4- running in Docker container
This repository contains all required files to build and run a docker container running **TK4-, Update 8** 
## Prerequisite
Running TK4- Update 8 in a docker container requires serveral updates to the default configuration supplied as part of the default installation of TK4- as available on https://github.com/patrickraths/sdl-hercules-390-aarch64.git

### SDL-Hercules 4.5
The Hercules version embedded as part of TK4- does not support AARCH64 architecture. To support this architecture Hercules has to be compiled from source. Compilinng and building the binaries and libraries for Hecules 4.5 is achieved using a different Docker container. For details refers to https://github.com/patrickraths/sdl-hercules-390-aarch64.git

### TK4-
The following changes were applied to the default TK4- Update 8 configuration as available on https://wotho.ethz.ch/tk4-/
- Remove embedded Hercules
- Remove all Windows related startup files
- Remove support to run Hercules in unattended (daemon) mode
- Modifed startup files

## Building the Docker image and running it as container
Building the container is controlled through the Dockerfile found in the root directory of this repository. To access the system using a 3270 Terminal Emulator as well as the SDL Hercules Web-Interface ports 3270 and 8038 must be made available on the host.
### Building blocks
- Dockerized SDL-Hercules-390 Version 4.5<br>
  A dockerized version of SDL-Hercules-390 Version 4.5 (https://github.com/patrickraths/docker-SDL-Hercules-390) is used as the base image to build the TK4 docker image.

- Build the image using `docker build -t tk4:latest .` This creates a new image called **TK4**
- Create a volume called tk4-dasd. This volume can be used to store persistent dasd files.
- Run the container using `docker run --name tk4 -it --mount src=tk4-dasd,target=/opt/tk4/dasd.usr -p 3270:3270 -p 8038:8038 tk4:latest` This creates a new container named **tk4** based on the previously created image, exposes ports 3270 and 8038 to the host and starts Hercules with MVS 3.8j

## Starting the container and accessing the console
When starting the container MVS 3.8j is automatically started using the mvs startup script. However, the console is not normally shown and can only be accessed using the web interface using http://localhost:8038. To "export" the console start the container using 
```
docker start -i tk4
```


## Customizing TK4-
### Changing the Timezone
To change the timezone modify **SYS1.PARMLIB(PARMTZ)**
*â€ Syntax*<br>
The member consists of one record
The member uses the syntax  D,HH[.MM[.SS]]

*Parameters*<br>
D is either "E" or "W" to specify a time zone east or west or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)
HH specifies the number of hours deviation from GMT (00-12)
MM specifies the number of minutes. Optional parameter. (00-59)
SS specifies the number of seconds. Optional parameter (00-59)

### Enabling the CBT Catalogue
To make the CBT Volumes **CBTCAT**, **CBT000**, **CBT001**, **CBT002** accessible through catalog search the respective user catalogs need to be connected and the high level qualifer aliases pointing to them need to be defined. 

To make the CBT Volumes accessibles submit job **SYS1.SETUP.CNTL(MVS0170) [issue **sub** on the Command line when viewing/editing the dataset]. This connects the SYS1.UCAT.CBT user catalog and defines the CBT, CBTCOV, CBT072, CBT129, CBT249, CBT429 HLQ aliases.

Recommendation:<br>
Change MSGCLASS from 'A' to 'H' so that the result of the job can be viewed

<img width="585" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43680256/229275001-82b5c4a7-8b9e-4284-83f3-9deddf85ce1c.png">

### Creating, cataloging, and using user DASD
It is recommended to create a separate DASD (Direct Access Storage Device) to store data on MVS that is not part of the TK4- standard configuration. By default all DASD are stored in [dasd] directory inside the TK4 folder structure. However, since the storage inside a docker container is not persistent, user DASD should be placed into the folder [dasd.usr] that is mounted as docker volume. 

#### Creating and catalog new DASD
There are different DASD types that vary in capacity; typical models as 3330, 3340, 3350, 3380, 3390, etc. However, TK4- odes not support DASD models after 3350, thus we will be using the model 3350 which provides a capacity of approximately 300MB.

MVS communicates to DASD devices through addresses. TK4- has assigned the following address ranges for DASD devices:
<img width="640" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43680256/229289077-eb87138d-e61f-4190-968b-8ba2e0680f48.png">

In TK4- the following addresses for DASD Model 3350 are in use:
| Address | Volume |
| :------ | :----- |
| 0140 | WORK00 |
| 0148 | MVSRES |
| 0149-014A | SMP001, SMP002 |
| 014B-014C | SMP003, SMP004 |
| 0240-0241 | PUB000, PUB010 |
| 0248 | MVSDLB |
| 0340-0342 | CBT000, CBT001, CBT002 |
| 0343 | CBTCAT |

For the actual use of addresses refer to the **conf/tk4-.cnf** file

1. Create DASD Image<br>
   For our purpose we want to create the following volume to store user data:
   | Address | Model | Volume |
   | :------ | :---- | :----- |
   | 034A | 3350 | USR000 |
   
   To create the DASD image, you will need to execute the dasdinit program in the terminal window. 
   
   ```
   /opt/hercules/bin/dasdinit -z -a /opt/tk4/dasd.usr/usr000.34a 3350 USR000
   ````
   >HHC02499I Hercules utility dasdinit - DASD image file creation program - version 4.5.0.10830-SDL-g58578601-modified<br>
   >HHC01414I (C) Copyright 1999-2022 by Roger Bowler, Jan Jaeger, and others<br>
   >HHC01417I ** The SoftDevLabs version of Hercules **<br>
   >HHC01415I Build date: Mar 28 2023 at 10:51:26<br>
   >HHC00462I 0:0000 CKD file /opt/tk4/dasd.usr/usr000.34a: creating 3350 volume USR000: 560 cyls, 30 trks/cyl, 19456 bytes/track<br>

   >HHC02423I DASD operation completed<br>

2. Attach the newly creased DASD<br>
   In order to attach an emulated device to Hercules while it is running, you will need to be in the text console display because there is no equivalent command in the graphical display.  The command syntax is:

   `attach <address> <devtype> <filename> [cu=3880]`

   To attach the previously created dasd use the following command in the MVS console:
   ```
   attach 034a 3350 dasd.usr/usr000.34a
   ```
   <img width="569" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43680256/229291338-b4438109-14fa-4a1e-a3f8-041459a4ef02.png">
   
3. Initalize the DASD Image for use by MVS
   Although the dasdinit program creates the raw DASD image, MVS requires additional information that is not written by dasdinit. The following JCL initalizes newly created DASD as Volume **USR000** using address **34A**, and assigns 1 Cylinder (30 Tracks) for the VTOC.
   
   ```
   //ICKDSF  JOB (1),ICKDSF,CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=H
   //ICKDSF EXEC PGM=ICKDSF,REGION=4096K
   //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
   //SYSIN    DD  *
   INIT UNITADDRESS(34A) NOVERIFY VOLID(USR000) OWNER(HERCULES) -
                VTOC(0,1,30)
   /*
   //
   ```
   
   You will be asked to confirm that you actually want to initialize the volume at the address specified:
   >*00 ICK003D REPLY U TO ALTER VOLUME 34A CONTENTS, ELSE T

   The reply of U allows the initialization to proceed.  There will be a number of informational messages printed in the SYSPRINT output during the executing of ICKDSF.  The most important thing to verify is that the return code for the job is 0000.
   
   <img width="564" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43680256/229292813-f8b2b471-e8b8-4bad-ae3c-8aabebefaf3b.png">

4. Set the volume online and mount it with the appropriate storage use class<br>
   After the volume is initialized, it must be placed online before MVS will be able to allocate the volume to allow jobs to create datasets on it.  On the MVS console issue the command `v <address>,online`
   
   <img width="566" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43680256/229293847-bbf79122-eec8-4ea6-b7eb-0a6f9cd8faa3.png">

   After the volume is set online it must be mounted.
   ```
   /m 34a,vol=(sl,usr000),use=private
   ```
   <img width="563" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43680256/229294052-0bf92643-5ae9-4a40-b6b0-e710d8375f1d.png">
   
   By using use=private new datasets will be created on this volume only if the user (via JCL or the TSO ALLOCATE command) specifies the volume serial of this disk volume.
   
5. Add the new volume to the MVS & Hercules configuration so it will be mounted automatically
   - Edit MVS Configuration<br>
     By modifying **SYS1.PARMLIB(VATLST00)** MVS will be instructed to automatically mount the volume, if accessible, and assign storage class 2 (Private)
     ```
     USR000,0,2,3350    ,N                  User Volume 1 
     ```
     <img width="636" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43680256/229294781-e78fd5d8-e0f8-4d2e-8155-c4d65568ddcf.png">

   - Edit Hercules Configuration<br>
     Modify the file /opt/tk4/dasd.usr/usr_dasd.cnf to automatically attach the newly created dasd at address 34a. This file is referenced as include in the TK4- base configuration file (/opt/tk4/conf/tk4-.cnf)
     ```
     #
     # User Added DASD
     #
     034a 3350 dasd.usr/usr000.34a
     ```

6. Set Up User Catalogs<br>
   Generally, when adding new storage space to the system, it is also a good time to think about how that storage space will integrate with the catalog structure in place for the system.

   During System Generation, a VSAM Master Catalog was created. It resides on MVSRES and the dataset name of the catalog itself is SYS1.VSAM.MASTER.CATALOG. Although any new datasets you created can be catalogued in the Master Catalog, it is not considered a good practice and would undoubtedly not be allowed in any real world shop.
   
   To create a User catalog called **UCUSR000** that resides on the new volume **USR000** that will be connected to the master catalog, submit the following JCL:

   ```
   //DEFUCAT JOB  (HERC02),
   //             'Define User Catalog',
   //             CLASS=A,
   //             MSGLEVEL=(1,1),
   //             MSGCLASS=H              
   //DEFUCAT EXEC PGM=IDCAMS,REGION=4096K                           
   //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*                                           
   //USR000 DD UNIT=3350,VOL=SER=USR000,DISP=OLD                    
   //SYSIN DD *                                                     
                                                                 
     /* THIS USER CATALOG WILL CONTAIN NON-VSAM DATASETS THAT     */
     /* RESIDE ON VOLUME USR000.                                  */
                                                                 
     DEFINE USERCATALOG ( -                                         
            NAME (UCUSR000) -                                       
            VOLUME (USR000) -                                       
            CYLINDERS (20) -                                        
            FOR (9999) -                                            
            BUFFERSPACE (8192) )                                    
                                                                 
     /* AN ALIAS IS DEFINED SO THAT ALL DATASETS WITH A HIGH-     */
     /* LEVEL QUALIFIER OF PUB000 WILL BE CATALOGUED IN THE       */
     /* USER CATALOG UCUSR000.                                    */
                                                                 
     DEFINE ALIAS ( -
            NAME (USR000) -      
            RELATE (UCUSR000) )
   /*
   //
   ```
#### Connecting an existing volume to a system
When a volume is brought into the system from a prior functioning system that has its own User Catalog on the volume, the volume must be attached, added to the MVS configuration, and the catalog connected to the master catalog

1. Copy DASD file<br>
   Copy the DASD file to /opt/tk4/dasd.usr directory, respectively run docker using `docker run --name tk4 -it --mount src=tk4-dasd,target=/opt/tk4/dasd.usr -p 3270:3270 -p 8038:8038 tk4:latest` with a docker volume that already contains the DASD files
   
2. Attach the DASD file mount the volume
   - Attach DASD & mount it
   Attach the DASE using the following command in the MVS console:
   ```
   attach 034a 3350 dasd.usr/usr000.34a
   ```
   Once the DASD is attach, set it online using `/v 34a,online` and mount it `/m 34a,vol=(sl,usr000),use=private`

3. Modify the MVS configuration to automatically mount the DASD
   - Edit MVS Configuration<br>
     By modifying **SYS1.PARMLIB(VATLST00)** MVS will be instructed to automatically mount the volume, if accessible, and assign storage class 2 (Private)
     ```
     USR000,0,2,3350    ,N                  User Volume 1 
     ```
     <img width="636" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43680256/229294781-e78fd5d8-e0f8-4d2e-8155-c4d65568ddcf.png">

   - Edit Hercules Configuration<br>
     Modify the file /opt/tk4/dasd.usr/usr_dasd.cnf to automatically attach the newly created dasd at address 34a. This file is referenced as include in the TK4- base configuration file (/opt/tk4/conf/tk4-.cnf)
     ```
     #
     # User Added DASD
     #
     034a 3350 dasd.usr/usr000.34a
     ```

4. Import existing Catalog<br>
   As the existing volume already contains a User Catalog it must be imported and connected to the master catalog using:
   ```
   //ADDUCAT JOB  (HERC02),
   //             'Add existing User Catalog",
   //             CLASS=S,
   //             MSGCLASS=H
   //ADDUCAT EXEC PGM=IDCAMS,REGION=4096K
   //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
   //SYSP01   DD  UNIT=3350,DISP=OLD,VOL=SER=USR000
   //SYSIN DD *

     /* THERE IS A USER CATALOG IN EXISTENCE ON SYSP01 THAT       */
     /* CONTAINS CATALOG ENTRIES FOR THE DATASETS ON THAT VOLUME. */
     /* IT IS CONNECTED TO THE MASTER CATALOG AND AN ALIAS IS     */
     /* DEFINED TO RELATE FUTURE DATASETS REFERENCES TO IT.       */

     IMPORT CONNECT OBJECTS((UCUSR000 VOLUME(UCUSR000) DEVT(3350)))
     DEFINE ALIAS(NAME(USR000) RELATE(UCUSR000))

   //
   ```
